## Pygame Tutorial
A game developed in Python using pygame module. <br>
This game was a practice from <b>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lp3jAExUCewBfMx3UZFkh5">Pygame Programming Tutorial</a>"</b> course by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim"><b>Tech With Tim</b></a> YouTube channel

### Instructions:
To execute the game, the user must run "teste.py" file. <br>
Please, do not edit any other files, they all are part of the source code.

### Acknowledgment:
I'd like to thank Tim from YouTube for the awesome course. Please, do never stop to post those contents for free on the Internet, because I'm sure I was not the only person helped by this.<br>
I've learned a lot: practicing the subjects learned by this course, I could develop <a href="https://github.com/caiofov/Ursos-Quest">my very first pygame game</a> by myself.
